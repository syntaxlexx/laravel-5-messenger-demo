# Laravel 5,6,7,8 ChatMessenger Demo (+ Pusher)

![Screenshot](acelords-messenger.jpg?raw=true "Screenshot")

This is a demo application for the [Laravel 5 messenger](https://github.com/lexxyungcarter/laravel-5-messenger) to showcase the capabilities for the package.

It is based on [**Laravel 8.x*](https://laravel.com) which is by far the best PHP framework at the time of commit.
